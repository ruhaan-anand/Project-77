       Visual Code studio is a offline software for coding and building websites. It is a offliine platform so you don't need internet to work on it. It is a really good platform because it has many shortcuts so it saves your time. To set it up you need to go to extensions and install only one extension called Live Server to see the output of your code on a different screen.
